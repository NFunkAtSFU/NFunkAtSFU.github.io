Today I have decided to begin the [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. I am going to follow the curriculum at <https://www.freecodecamp.org/> and get my web coding skills back up to date. I want to improve the look of this blog and get better at using CSS and Javascript. A time for new beginnings!

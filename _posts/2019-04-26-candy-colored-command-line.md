This week I have been testing out a new way of working with the command line. Using [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/index.html) and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), along with some other plugins, I now have an interface that is surprisingly fun to work with. My inspiration came from this blog <https://ryanwhocodes.com/blog/zsh-style-powerlevel9k/> and I even checked out the lolcat and colorls links at the bottom of his post. Another post that was helpful was <https://jessicadeen.com/macos-ohmyzsh-tmux-vim-iterm2-powerlevel9k-badass-terminal/>.

I also followed a free tutorial by Wes Bos, [Command Line Power User](https://commandlinepoweruser.com/), which walked through setup, providing some tips for installing tools like [Z](https://github.com/rupa/z) and (Trash)[https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash].

Next, I want to get more familiar with using the vi editor, and there is gameful way of doing that with [VIM Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) on the web.

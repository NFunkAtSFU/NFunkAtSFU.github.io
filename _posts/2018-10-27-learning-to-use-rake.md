Today I made some satisfying progress in automatiing the process of naming my blog posts. I found a useful script by Arjan Van Der Gaag on his own blog at <http://arjanvandergaag.nl/blog/creating-new-jekyll-posts.html>. It didn't work for me at first, though. After doing a web search for my error messages, I learned that I needed to first import the date object and also provide a default for the Rake commands in the script. Then I customized a few additional fields for my yaml header for each post. After some testing today, I am happy with the results, and hope that this will make future posts easier to get started.

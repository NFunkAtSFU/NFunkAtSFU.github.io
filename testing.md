# This is a test
I _wanted_ to make this look a certain way. This **example** is calling the testing layout in its frontmatter. The testing layout itself is calling the wrapper template. So there can be a chain of dependencies and partial layouts that you define. This testing page accumulates all the references contained within the testing layout. 

One confusing aspect is that when you are using a theme, it is not obvious what elements are accounted for already. It might be good to visit the minima theme homepage to get better acquainted with what defaults it already uses, so that when you make custom pages, you can account for all the missing elements that you will have to define from scratch.
